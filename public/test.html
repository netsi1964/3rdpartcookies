    <h1>This is a test of <a href="https://github.com/netsi1964/3rdpartycookies" target="_blank">3rdpartycookies</a>
    </h1>
    <blockquote>I have tried to make a simple page which will try to set a cookie and send a <code>message</code> to the
        page which have included the test in an iframe like this:<br>
        <pre>&lt;iframe src="https://3rdpartycookies.netlify.app/"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</pre>
        The idea is that it could be used to test if people have blocked for 3rdparty cookies.
